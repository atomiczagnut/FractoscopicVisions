## About Fractoscopic Visions

Fractoscopic Visions was founded by [Colin Trierweiler](colin.html) in 2012, right before the world ended.

What originally started as a business selling psychedelic posters has evolved into something so much more.  As is the nature of fractals, diving deeper into the subject revealed connections in other artforms and disciplines.

Now, in addition to visual art, we study music, computer code, mathematics, philosophy, and nature itself.
