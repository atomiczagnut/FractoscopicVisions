## Visual Art

We make our psychedelic designs in a number of different ways.

I really like to work in [GIMP](https://gimp.org).  Render something with QBist, and then lay a fractal over the top.  Make sure that the colors contrast, and that it looks *cool*, in general.

From there, I might use JWarp to add some other interest to an otherwise repetitive pattern.

One of the things I like most about fractals is that, though they repeat themselves, they always do so a little differently.

There is always a new twist.

You can buy some of art to decorate your home in my [Zazzle Store](https://zazzle.com/store/fractoscopic)
